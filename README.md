This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br />
This project is built and published to [GitPages](https://aztianpahola.github.io/Learning-React/) through Travis-CI.

## Preface

This project was largely created through the tutorial described in Robin Wieruch's ['The Road to React'](https://www.roadtoreact.com/) as part of an in-class process to educate us regarding React, version control and continuous integration.

## My Contribution

Following the tutorial within the book was of course not the main objective of this project.
Our task was to take the project and build upon it using tools of continuous integration and version control.
In my case, these were Travis-CI and Git.
This of course is the github page, the Travis-CI page can be found [Here](https://travis-ci.org/github/AztianPahola/Learning-React)

Using these tools, any change made to the repository is automatically tested through YAML scripts calling tests within the project.
